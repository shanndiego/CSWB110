<p align="justify">My name is Shannon Aston and I was born in New Zealand, but I have</br>
been a full time resident in the United States for a couple of years now, as </br> 
my wife was born here. I hope to learn a lot in the class and improve my skills, </br>
along with a Javascript class I'm taking.  I am a qualified Social Science teacher</br> in California,
but I am considering a move into computing. I like to take trips </br>with my wife  
and my Boston Terrier/Pug <i>'Bruce'</i> around the country. </br>  My hobbies are surfing, photography,
the outdoors and travel.</p>

<!-- The H1 is centered, and the nav bar is align left.    
There is a photograph here that I have taken myself.
There is a small footer below with a link to my website 

I removed the <hr> tag n the footer

I changed the color scheme to uniform with the main after testing issues
I added a favicon to the id of the site with a screenshot of the page converted to 32x32 .ico file name. I added the javascript lastmodified to the footer  -->
